# logger-express

A simple logger for Node and Express.

## Installation

To install the package, execute the following command:

``````
npm install logger-express
``````

## Usage

To use the logger, import the package into your code:

```
import { logger } from "logger-express";
```

```
const loggerOption = {
  logToFile: true, // If you need to log information to a file
  colorize: true, // enable console colors
  infoColor: "magenta", // set a color for information messages
  errorColor: "red", // set a color for error messages:
};
```

Finally, add the logger middleware to your application:

```
app.use(logger(loggerOption));
```

## Options

The logger has the following options:

 🗃️ **logToFile**: Indicates whether information should be logged to a file. The default value is true.


 🌈 **colorize**: Indicates whether console colors should be used. The default value is true.


 💡 **infoColor**: Color for information messages. The default value is magenta.


❌ **errorColor**: Color for error messages. The default value is red.

If no options are provided, the logger will use its default configuration.
## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the logger to log the request and response information of an application:

```
import express from "express";
const { logger } = require("logger-express");

const app = express();
const loggerOption = {
  logToFile: true, // If you need to log information to a file
  colorize: true, // enable console colors
  infoColor: "magenta", // set a color for information messages
  errorColor: "red", // set a color for error messages:
};

app.use(express.json());
app.use(logger(loggerOption));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world.");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("The application is listening on port 3000.");
});

```

When you run the application and visit the route /, the logger will record the following information in the console:

```
Started GET /api/1 for :: ::ffff:127.0.0.1 at Sat Oct 14 2023 17:32:19 GMT-0300 (Chile Summer Time)
Parameters in body: {}
```
🚨 To display the body information, you should use the express.json() middleware before the logger.

If you visit a route and an error occurs, the logger will log the following message in the console with the corresponding error code:
```
Completed: 500 message: Internal Server Error Time response: 10 ms Request ID: [34273466-07c3-470d-8099-146236c93e02]
```
On the other hand, if the query is successful, the following will be displayed:
```
Completed: 200 message:  Time response: 1 ms Request ID: [92d17d54-5a62-4618-815a-18dae2bc7b00]
```
The logger will also log information to a file if the logToFile option is set to true. The log file will be created in the logs folder and will be named with the current date, creating a new file for each day.

## Issues

If you have any suggestions or want to report any errors, you can visit the project's home page.

## New built-in feature

This new version incorporates a new functionality for you to set a size for the log folder (this applies only if you have the logToFile option set to true). When the folder size exceeds the set limit, files will be deleted, leaving only the last 5 days of records. This cleanup will occur every 10 days. To add a size, you must include the sizeLogFile property and set the size in megabytes, as I will show you below.

````
const loggerOption = {
  logToFile: true, // If you need to log information to a file
  sizeLogFile: 5, // Set the size of the log folder in megabytes
  colorize: true, // enable console colors
  infoColor: "magenta", // set a color for information messages
  errorColor: "red", // set a color for error messages:
};
````

Note: the default size is 5 megabytes.
